					<ol>
						<li>I reserve the right to alter these terms as needed with notice to any active clients that changes may affect. 
							These terms are not permanent and will be adjusted as needed.</li>
						<li>All clients, as well as the characters/subjects requested, <i>must</i> be of or over the age of 18, or risk immediate rejection. Characters additionally must visibly <i>look</i> 18 or older.</li>
						<li>Any prompts portraying criminal or non-consensual acts, or content that is derogatory to specific groups (ie. sexism, racism, etc.) are 
							liable to be rejected immediately.</li>
						<li>I focus mainly on masculine and gay topics. As such, I am primarily interested in highly masculine characters and anatomy, and would like to prioritize those types of subjects for fetish-related art.
							If you are interested in feminine or androgynous characters or content catered towards straight audiences, I would suggest utilizing different artists as they would likely yield a much better final product than myself.</li>
						<li>While I do not prefer drawing humans, I will make some exceptions for particular designs I enjoy or for certain human characters wearing face-concealing garmets like helmets.</li>
						<li>I reserve the right to reject a prompt for my own personal reasons outside of these terms, including but not limited to the case of being personally uninterested in 
							the subject matter or strongly believing that I cannot portray it properly.</li>
						<li>I respect the client’s need to change or ask for corrections in the event an element is incorrect or missing. However, I reserve the right 
							to reject change requests, cancel a commission, or request monetary compensation if the corrections and alterations are in excess or occur after a phase of the drawing where it becomes difficult to edit.</li>
						<li>While I will frequently check in with clients during the commission process, the client reserves the right to ask for progress updates of their commission when needed. However, please do not ask for daily updates, as some days I may
							jump to other pieces that require my attention. Constant check-ins and updates are also extremely disruptive to my work, and I may ask to reduce the number of check-ins.</li>
						<li>Payment for commissions will take place after a concept sketch is made and confirmed with the client. For YCH's, payment will generally be up-front. Once the payment is fully processed, 
							the piece will then move on to completion. Once a piece is completed and the client has confirmed its completion, I will not accept any 
							refund requests.</li>	
						<li>Upon completion, the client will receive their commission and any alternate versions in the form of PNG files via direct messages or a cloud drive link.
							Cloud drive links are NOT permanent, and may be deleted from the drive at any time.</li>
						<li>All commissions are expected to be posted to my social media accounts. The client may choose to have their accounts mentioned when 
							uploading, or remain anonymous. The client may upload their commissions to their own social media accounts in these cases. The client may 
							also choose to keep the commission private.</li>
						<li>In the case of private commissions, if found acceptable by the client, I may create an altered version of the piece with swapped
							colors and any distinct/identifiable characteristics changed or removed to prevent client identification. In these 
							cases, the pieces will be treated as personal works and uploaded to my Patreon/SubscribeStar for early access, then posted to my
							other accounts without mentioning the client. For transparency to my audience, I may include that the pieces are altered from private commissions in the posts (though 
							this may be omitted on special request). The client may request to preview the alternate piece before uploading.</li>
						<li>If a client chose to keep a commission private, yet publicly shares the piece themselves, I reserve the right to then post the piece 
							myself, including linking to the account or the name of the account the piece was posted to. Clients may also keep a commission private 
							for a specified amount of time before having the piece be posted.</li>
						<li>At no point is <i>any</i> work commissioned from me to be used in or in support of any form of NFT, cryptocurrency, blockchain-based technology, 
							pyramid schemes/multi-layer-marketing schemes, AI image generation (for training, generation, promotion, or any affiliation whatsoever) or any other 
							environmentally/morally/artistically dubious and harmful practices, including for political purposes.</li>
						<li>Clients may edit their commissions. However, they must disclose that they edited it if shared, and must not remove the signature on the 
							piece. They may add their own signature if they made additions or changes, so long as it specifies that they were an editor and not the 
							original artist.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><b>Subjects and fetishes I generally do <i>not</i> draw (this does NOT automatically mean I condemn all listed items, 
						only that I personally do not wish to draw them):</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Extreme bottom-heavy or “pear shaped” characters (this can be subjective, so asking first is recommended)</li>
						<li>Toilet-related fetishes (ex. scat, watersports)</li>
						<li>Extreme gore/death</li>
						<li>Berry/Blueberry inflation</li>
						<li>Pooltoy characters</li>
						<li>“Closed species” or species associated with them</li>
						<li>Diapers, “baby-fur,” or anything childhood/baby-related (I additionally WILL NOT age-up a character for you, the character MUST have a canonical or widely-accepted, distinct, and lore-plausible adult version)</li>
						<li>Giant lips/heavy makeup (exaggerated lower lips are fine, as well as light makeup. Asking with specific examples is recommended)</li>
						<li>Cross-dressing, drag, or femboys</li>
						<li>Monobutts or null bulges</li>
						<li>Frilly or lacy clothes/undergarments (ex. lingerie)</li>
						<li>Content that can be interpreted as politically charged in any way</li>
					</ul>
