					<ul>
						<li>I reserve the right to alter these terms as needed with notice to any active clients. 
							These terms are not permanent and will be adjusted as needed.</li>
						<li>All clients, as well as the characters/OCs requested, <i>must</i> be of or over the age of 18, or risk immediate rejection.</li>
						<li>Any prompts portraying criminal or non-consensual acts, or content that is derogatory to specific groups (ie. sexism, racism, etc.) are 
							liable to be rejected immediately.</li>
						<li>I reserve the right to reject a prompt for my own personal reasons outside of these terms, including if I am personally uninterested in 
							the subject matter or if I feel that I cannot portray it properly.</li>
						<li>I respect the client’s need to change or ask for corrections in the event an element is incorrect or missing. However, I reserve the right 
							to reject corrections or cancel a commission or request monetary compensation if there are too many correction requests or changes.</li>
						<li>The client reserves the right to ask for progress updates and previews on their commission at any time during the process.</li>
						<li>All commissions are expected to be posted to my social media accounts. The client may choose to have their accounts mentioned when 
							uploading, or remain anonymous. The client may upload their commissions to their own social media accounts in these cases. The client may 
							also choose to keep the commission private. However, if a client chose to keep a commission private, yet publicly shared the piece 
							themselves, I reserve the right to then post the piece myself, including any account or the name of the account 
							the piece was posted with.</li>
						<li>The sketches and full resolution versions of each commission, as well as alternate versions, are expected to be posted to my Patreon after 
							completion.</li>
						<li>Payment for commissions will take place after a concept sketch is made and confirmed with the client. Once the payment is fully processed, 
							the piece will then move on to completion. Once a piece is completed and the client has confirmed its completion, I will not accept any 
							refund requests.</li>
						<li>At no point is <i>any</i> work commissioned by me to be used in or in support of any form of NFT, cryptocurrency, blockchain-based technology, 
							pyramid schemes/multi-layer-marketing schemes, AI image generation (for training, generation, or any affiliation whatsoever) or any other 
							environmentally/morally/artistically dubious and harmful practices, including for political purposes.</li>
						<li>Clients may edit their commissions. However, they must disclose that they edited it if shared, and must not remove the signature on the 
							piece. They may add their own signature if they made additions or changes, so long as it specifies that they were an editor and not the 
							original artist.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><b>Subjects and fetishes I generally do <i>not</i> draw (this does NOT automatically mean I condemn all listed items,
						 simply that I personally do not wish to draw them):</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Extreme bottom-heavy or “pear shaped” characters (this can be subjective, so asking first is recommended)</li>
						<li>Toilet-related fetishes such as scat or watersports</li>
						<li>Extreme gore/death</li>
						<li>Humans (exceptions may be made for characters like knights with full face coverage)</li>
						<li>“Closed species” or species associated with them</li>
						<li>Diapers, “baby-fur,” or anything childhood/baby-related</li>
						<li>Giant lips/heavy makeup (exaggerated lower lips are fine, as well as light or “tasteful” makeup. 
							Asking with specific prompts is recommended)</li>
						<li>Content that can be interpreted as politically charged in any way</li>
					</ul>
